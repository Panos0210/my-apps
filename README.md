# my-apps
just a repo with all of my apps that ive made 
(including batch)

# DISCLAIMER:
any apps on the Dependancies folder are not from me but are needed for other apps to work and are gotten from the developers.
for any apps that i could prevent this i did (like ffmpeg).
also credit will be givn here with the site that i got the .exe

# How to use
for gamdl youll need your cookies.txt file on the same directory as the .bat file. also python is needed to be installed
instructions on how to get your cookies.txt file can be found on the official gamdl repo
